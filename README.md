This repo is a clone of [Brandon's workout bot](https://github.com/brandonshin/slackbot-workout)

The only updates I made are following:

- Updated python version to 3
- Containerized the application
- Added a WebServer that runs and stops the script using slash commands on slack
- Integrated with Github Actions

The app isn't very bug free and i'm continually making updates! If you have any suggestions, feel free to fork and make updates!
